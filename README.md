Email Spam Detection

The Email Spam Detection system is a critical and widely addressed problem in the field of natural language processing and machine learning. The primary objective is to accurately classify emails as either "spam" or "non-spam" (ham) to improve email filtering and user experience.

By leveraging various text processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, your model efficiently analyzes the content and features of emails to make informed predictions. These techniques may include word/tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, or even deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based architectures.

The Email Spam Detection system goes beyond its immediate impact on email management. It plays a vital role in mitigating cyber threats, protecting users from phishing attacks, and reducing the risk of data breaches.
