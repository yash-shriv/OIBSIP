1. Email Spam Detection

The Email Spam Detection system is a critical and widely addressed problem in the field of natural language processing and machine learning. The primary objective is to accurately classify emails as either "spam" or "non-spam" (ham) to improve email filtering and user experience.

By leveraging various text processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, your model efficiently analyzes the content and features of emails to make informed predictions. These techniques may include word/tokenization, stop-word removal, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, or even deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based architectures.

The Email Spam Detection system goes beyond its immediate impact on email management. It plays a vital role in mitigating cyber threats, protecting users from phishing attacks, and reducing the risk of data breaches.

2. Car Price Prediction :

Car price prediction is a machine learning project aimed at developing a model to estimate the prices of used cars accurately. By analyzing various attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and fuel type, the model provides valuable insights for buyers and sellers in the used car market, helping them make informed decisions and strategize their pricing effectively. Through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, this predictive tool offers real-time price estimations for different car configurations, improving the overall transparency and efficiency of the buying and selling process.

3. Iris Flower Classification

Iris is a genus of around 300 species of flowering plants. It takes the name from the Greek goddess of rainbow, Iris.

The Iris flower data set is also know as the Fisher's Iris data set. It is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in his paper, The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. iris

The data set is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris, the errors are modified as well. It consists the following information for 150 samples,

sepal length (in cm)

sepal width (in cm)

petal length (in cm)

petal width (in cm)

class: -> Iris Setosa -> Iris Versicolour -> Iris Virginica
